This course provides a broad introduction to different machine learning paradigms and algorithms and lays a foundation for further study or independent work in AIML. Some topics we'll cover include: linear models, support vector machines, neural networks, clustering, principal components analysis, Markov decision processes, planning, and reinforcement learning. The goals of this course are three-fold: to understand the landscape of ML, how to compute the mathematics behind techniques, and how to use Python and relevant libraries to implement and use various methods.
